! ! Set nonbonded options
! nbonds atom -
! fswitch -                !! (use "switch" for openMM) Use force switch for elec-nb interactions
! cdie eps 1 -             !! Set constant dielectric value of 1
! vdw vfswitch -            !! Set nb VDW using switching function
! cutnb 15.0 -             !! Set nb list cut off to 15A
! cutim 15.0 -             !! Set image nb list cut off to 15A
! ctonnb 10.0 ctofnb 12.0   !! Switching function used from 10A to 12A for VDW interaction
